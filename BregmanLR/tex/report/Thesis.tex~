\chapter{Geometry of Convex Polyhedral Cones}
\section{Preliminaries}
Before we can define toric varieties we must develop some results in convex geometry, a subject to which the theory of toric varieties is intimately related. Most standard references (e.g. \cite{Danilov}, \cite{Ewald} and even the otherwise comprehensive \cite{Cox}) on toric varieties fail to properly address some of the subtleties involved and use the theory that we develop in this section implicitly. The best text in this regard is \cite{Fulton:Toric}, which provides an outline of the required results. Unfortunately the proofs are lacking in detail and the proof of the most difficult lemma (called the Fundamental Lemma below) is omitted. This situation can be frustrating for the beginner. In this section we give a complete account of the theory that will be used in our study of toric varieties. 

\begin{Definition}
A {\em lattice} $N$ is a free $\Z$-module of finite rank. The {\em dual lattice} of $N$ is the dual $\Z$-module $M:= \Hom(N,\Z)$ and we have a canonical $\Z$-bilinear dual pairing $ N \times M\longrightarrow \Z$ given by $(x, f) \mapsto f(x).$ We identify $N$ with its image under the natual embedding of $N$ into the real vector space $N_{\R} := N \otimes_{\Z} \R.$ Elementary properties of tensor products imply that $M_{\R}:=M \otimes_{\Z} \R $ is the dual vector space of $N_{\R}.$ The natural dual pairing $N_{\R} \times M_{\R} \longrightarrow \Z$ extends the previous map so we denote both by $\langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle.$
\end{Definition}

\begin{Definition} A {\em convex polyhedral cone} in $N_{\R}$ is a set of the form $$ \sigma = \Cone(u_1,\ldots, u_k):= \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^k r_i u_i \in N_{\R} \  \bigg|  \ r_i \geq 0 \right\}.$$ We say $\sigma$ is {\em generated} by $u_1, \cdots, u_k \in N_{\R}.$  A convex polyhedral cone is said to be {\em rational} if it is generated by a subset of the lattice $N,$ and is said to be {\em strongly convex} if $\sigma \cap (-\sigma) = \{ 0 \}.$ The {\em dimension} $\dim \sigma$ is the dimension of the linear space $\R \sigma = \sigma + (-\sigma).$

Associated to a convex polyhedral cone $\sigma$ its {\em dual cone}  $$\sigma^{\V} := \{ v\in M_{\R} \ | \ \langle u, v \rangle \geq 0 \ , \ \forall u \in \sigma \}.$$ To ensure $v \in \sigma^{\V}$ it suffices to check $v$ is nonnegative on a set of generators of $\sigma.$
For any $v\in M_{\R}$ there is an associated hyperplane $v^{\perp} := \{ u \in N_{\R} \ | \ \langle u, v \rangle =0 \}.$ A {\em face} $\tau$ of a convex polyhedral cone is a set of the form $$\tau := \sigma \cap u^{\perp} =\{ v\in \sigma \ | \ \langle v, u \rangle =0 \}$$ for some $u\in \sigma^{\V} .$ 

If $u\in \sigma^{\V}$ we call $u^{\perp}$ a {\em supporting hyperplane} of $\sigma$ because $\sigma$ lies entirely in the closed half-space described by $\langle x , u \rangle \geq 0.$ Thus a face of a convex polyhedral cone is the intersection of that cone with a supporting hyperplane.

\end{Definition}

\begin{Remark} A convex polyhedral cone $\sigma$ is a convex set and is a cone in the sense that $u\in \sigma$ implies $ru\in \sigma$ for all $r\geq 0.$
\end{Remark}

\begin{Example} Take the lattice $N=\Z^2$ and the two dimensional rational convex polyhedral cone $\sigma=\Cone(e_1, e_2).$

It has dual cone  
\begin{align*}
\sigma^{\V} &= \{ (x,y)\in \R^2 \ | \ \langle (1,0), (x,y)\rangle \geq 0  \text{ and } \langle (0,1), (x,y) \rangle \geq 0 \} \\
            &= \{ (x,y) \in \R^2 \ | \ x\geq 0 \text{ and }  y\geq 0 \}.
\end{align*}
We enumerate the faces of $\sigma.$ The points $(a,b)\in \sigma^{\V}$ are the pairs (a,b) with nonnegative entries. If we take $u=(0,0)$ then $\tau_0 = \sigma \cap (0,0)^{\perp} = \sigma$ is the entire cone. If we take $u=(a,0)$ where $a>0$ then $ \tau_1 = \sigma \cap (a,0)^{\perp} = \{ (x,y)\in \sigma \ | \ x=0 \} = \Cone(e_1) $ is the nonnegative half of the y-axis. Similarly, the face with $u=(0,b)$ ($b>0$) gives us the positive x-axis: $\tau_2 = \Cone(e_2).$ The last possibility is $a,b>0.$ In that case the face with $u=(a,b)$ is $\tau_3 = \{ (x,y)\in \sigma  \ | \ ax+by=0 \} $ and since that line $ax+by=0$ only intersects the first quadrant at the origin, $\tau_3=\{(0,0)\}.$ 
\end{Example}
\section{The Fundamental Lemma}
The aim of this section is to prove a technical lemma from which many results in the next section follow. Before we begin we observe that there is a natural topology on the vector spaces $N_{\R}$ and $M_{\R}.$ Suppose $V$ is $d$ dimensional real vector space, so there is a vector space isomorphism $f:V \to \R^d.$ We have a topology on $V$ by taking this map to be a homeomorphism, so $U\subseteq V$ is open if and only if $f(U)\subseteq \R^d$ is open in the Euclidean topology. This gives $V$ the same topological properties as $\R^d.$ In particular, it turns $V$ into a Hausdorff locally convex real vector space. Suppose we define the topology on $V$ via another isomorphism $g:V\to \R^d$ instead. Since we declared $f$ and $g$ to be homeomorphisms, $g\circ f^{-1} : \R^d \to \R^d$ is also a homeomorphism. Hence $f(U)$ is open if and only if $ (g\circ f^{-1}) (f(U)) = g(U)$ is open. Therefore any isomorphism induces the same canonical topology. For finite dimensional topological vector spaces the algebraic dual and continuous dual spaces coincide, so $N_{\R}$ and $M_{\R}$ remain dual as topological vector spaces. 

\begin{Theorem}[Hahn-Banach]\label{HB} Suppose $p:V \to R$ is sublinear (that is, $p(tx) = t p(x)$ for all nonnegative $t\in \R$ and $p(x+y)\leq p(x) + p(y)$ for all $x$ and $y$ in $V$) and $\varphi:W\to \R$ is a linear functional on a subspace $W\subseteq V.$ If $\varphi(x) \leq p(x)$ for all $x\in W$ then there exists a linear extension $\eta: V \to \R$ of $\varphi$ such that $\eta(x)\leq p(x)$ for all $x\in V.$ 
\end{Theorem}

\begin{proof} See any texts on functional analysis e.g. \cite[p.~ 77]{Conway} . \end{proof}

 
\begin{Lemma} \label{Minkowski sublinear} Let $X$ be a topological vector space and suppose that $C$ is an open convex neighbourhood of the origin. If $q(x)= \inf \{t>0\mid x\in tC \}$ then $q:X\to \R$ is a nonnegative sublinear function and $q(c)<1$ for all $c\in C.$
\end{Lemma}

\begin{proof} C.f. \cite[page 108]{Conway}. The scaling map $t\mapsto tx$ is continuous since $X$ is a topological vector space, and in particular continuous at $t=0.$ The preimage of $C$ (an open neighbourhood of the origin) is an open subset of $\R$ containing $0.$ Any such set must contain a closed interval $[-\epsilon, \epsilon]$ for some $\epsilon>0,$ so the image of this interval under the scaling map lies in $C.$ In particular, $\epsilon x \in C,$ or $x\in \epsilon^{-1} C.$ Therefore $q(x)$ is the infimum of a non-empty set of positive real numbers, so $q(x)$ is defined and nonnegative for all $x\in X.$ 

Suppose now that $\lambda >0,$ for otherwise the condition $q(\lambda x)=\lambda q(x)$ is satisfied trivially. We have the following chain of equalities:
\begin{align*}
q(\lambda x) &= \inf \{ t>0 \ | \ \lambda x \in tC \} \\
            &= \inf \{ t>0 \ | \  x \in \lambda^{-1}tC \} \\
						&= \lambda \inf \{ \lambda^{-1} t>0 \ | \  x \in \lambda^{-1}tC \} \\
						&= \lambda q(x).
\end{align*}

Now suppose $x,y\in C$ and take any $t,s>0$ such that $x\in tC, y\in sC.$ Then by convexity, $$ \frac{t}{t+s} (t^{-1}x) + \frac{s}{t+s} (s^{-1}y) = \frac{x+y}{t+s} \in C$$ so $t+s \geq q(x+y).$ Therefore $q(x)+q(y) \geq q(x+y).$ We have shown that $q$ is a sublinear function. 

Again consider the scaling function $t\mapsto tx$ for some $x\in C.$ The preimage of the open set $C$ is also an open set, and it contains $t=1$ since $x\in C.$ Hence there is an $\epsilon>0$ such that the image under the scaling map of $[1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon]$ is contained inside $C.$ In particular, $(1+\epsilon) x \in C$ so $q(x) \leq (1+\epsilon)^{-1}<1.$ 
\end{proof}


\begin{Lemma} \label{A} Let $X$ be a real topological vector space and $C$ be an open convex neighbourhood of the origin. If $x_0\notin C$ then there is a linear functional $\phi:X \to \R$ such that $\phi(x_0)=1$ and $\phi(c)<1$ for all $c\in C.$ 
\end{Lemma}

\begin{proof} 
Let $Y= \R x_0.$ Define the linear functional $\eta: Y \to \R $ by $\eta(tx_0)=t.$
If $t\neq 0$ then $\eta(tx_0)\leq q(tx_0)$ holds since by \ref{Minkowski sublinear} $q$ is a nonnegative sublinear function. If $t>0$ then by the positive homogeneity of sublinear functions we have $q(tx_0) = t q(x_0)$ such $\eta(tx_0)\leq q(tx_0)$ is true if and only if $1\leq q(x_0),$ which is true since $x_0\notin C.$ So $q$ is a sublinear function that dominates $\eta$ and so by the Hahn-Banach theorem (\ref{HB}) there is a linear functional $\phi:X \to \R$ that extends $\eta$ (so $\phi(x_0)=1$) and is dominated by $q.$ That is, $\phi(x)\leq q(x)$ for all $x\in X.$ By \ref{Minkowski sublinear}, $q(c)<1$ for all $c\in C$ so $\phi(c)<1$ for all $c\in C$ as well. 
\end{proof}

\begin{Lemma} \label{B} Let $X$ be a real topological vector space and let $A, B$ be non-empty convex subsets of $X.$ Suppose $A$ and $B$ are disjoint with $A$ open. Then there exists a linear functional $\phi:X\to \R$ and $\alpha\in R$ such that $\phi(a) < \alpha \leq \phi(b)$ for all $a\in A, b\in B.$ We can choose $b\in B$ so that $\phi(b)$ is arbitrarily close to $\alpha.$

\end{Lemma}

\begin{proof} Fix $a_0\in A, b_0 \in B.$ The set $C:= A - B +b_0 - a_0 = \{ a-b+b_0-a_0 | a\in A, b\in B \}$ is a convex set containing the origin. Writing $C = \cup_{b\in B} (A+b_0-a_0)$ shows that $C$ is open. Let $x_0 = b_0-a_0.$ Then $x_0\notin C$ since $A$ and $B$ are disjoint. By \ref{A} there is a linear functional $\phi:X \to \R$ such that $\phi(x_0)=1$ and $\phi(c)<1$ for all $c\in C.$ Linearity of $\phi$ and the relation $x_0 = b_0-a_0$ gives $1= \phi(x_0) = \phi(b_0) - \phi(a_0).$ Taking $c= a-b+b_0 - a_0$ for some $a\in A, b\in B$ in this last inequality gives $\phi(a) < \phi(b)+ \phi(a_0) - \phi(b_0)+1 = \phi(b).$ Let $\alpha:= \inf_{b\in B} \{ \phi(b) \}$ which is finite since $\phi(a_0)\leq \alpha.$ Then $\phi(a)\leq \alpha \leq \phi(b).$ Suppose there is some $a_1\in A$ such that $\phi(a_1)=\alpha.$ At $t=0,$ the continuous map $t\mapsto a_1 + tx_0$ is $a_1,$ an element in the open set $A.$ Therefore the preimage of $A$ is an open set containing the origin, and hence also containing $[-\epsilon, \epsilon]$ for some $\epsilon>0.$ In particular, $a_1+\epsilon x_0 \in A.$ Taking $a= a_1+\epsilon x_0$ in the inequality $\phi(a)\leq \alpha$ gives $\alpha+\epsilon \leq \alpha,$ which is absurd. Therefore $\phi(a) < \alpha$ for all $a\in A$ 
\end{proof}

\begin{Proposition}[Fundamental Lemma]\label{Fundamental Lemma}

If $\sigma$ is a convex polyhedral cone in $N_{\R}$ and $v\notin \sigma$ then there exists a $u\in \sigma^{\V}$ such that $ \langle v , u \rangle < 0.$ 
\end{Proposition} 

\begin{proof} The vector space $N_{\R}$ has a natural Hausdorff locally convex topology in which $\sigma$ is a closed convex set. Since $v$ is not in (the closure of) $\sigma,$ there is some open convex set $V$ containing $v$ that is disjoint from $\sigma.$ By \ref{B}, there is a linear functional $u : N_{\R}\to \R$ and $\alpha \in \R$ such that $\langle w, u \rangle < \alpha \leq \langle x , u \rangle $ for every $w\in V, x\in \sigma,$ and we can choose $x\in \sigma$ such that $\langle x, u\rangle$ is arbitrarily close to $\alpha.$ Since $\sigma$ contains the origin, $\alpha \leq 0.$ Suppose $\alpha < 0.$ Then there is some $x_0\in \sigma$ such that $\langle x_0 , u \rangle < 0.$ This implies that $ \langle tx_0, u \rangle < \langle v , u \rangle$ for sufficiently large $t.$ Since $\sigma$ is a cone, $tx_0\in \sigma$ for all $t\geq 0.$ These contradict our choice of $u.$ Therefore we must have $\alpha =0.$ 
\end{proof} 

\section{Facts in Convex Geometry}

In this section we prove some lemmas that will be used repeatedly in later chapters. 

\begin{Lemma}\label{C}
Under the natural identification of a finite dimensional space with its double dual, the double dual of a convex polyhedral cone is itself. That is, $(\sigma^{\V})^{\V} = \sigma.$
\end{Lemma}

\begin{proof}
A vector $v\in \sigma$ is in $(\sigma^{\V})^{\V}$ if and only if it has nonnegative dual pairing with every $u\in \sigma^{\V},$ which is true by the definition of $\sigma^{\V}.$ Therefore $\sigma \subseteq (\sigma^{\V})^{\V}.$ If $v\notin \sigma$ then by \ref{Fundamental Lemma}, $v\notin (\sigma^{\V})^{\V}.$
\end{proof}

\begin{Lemma}\label{D} A face of a (rational) convex polyhedral cone is also a (rational) convex polyhedral cone, and there are only finitely many faces of a convex polyhedral cone.
\end{Lemma}

\begin{proof} Let $\sigma = \Cone(u_1,\ldots, u_k)$ be a convex polyhedral cone. A face of $\sigma$ is a set of the form $\tau = \sigma \cap u^{\perp}$ for some $u\in \sigma^{\V}.$ An element $t_1 u_1 + t_2 u_2 + \ldots + t_k u_k$ ($t_i \geq 0$) of $\sigma$ is in $\tau$ if and only if $$\bigg\langle \sum_{i=1}^k t_i u_i, u \bigg\rangle= \sum_{i=1}^k t_i \langle u_i, u \rangle =0.$$ Since $u\in \sigma^{\V}$ is positive on $\sigma,$ all the terms in the sum are nonnegative and the above equality holds $t_i=0$ for every $i$ for which $\langle u_i, u \rangle \neq 0.$ Therefore $\tau = \Cone (u_{i_1}, \ldots, u_{i_j} )$ where $\{ u_{i_j} \}$ is the subset of $\{ u_i \}$ for which $\langle u_i, u \rangle =0.$ There are at most $2^k$ subsets so there are at most $2^k$ faces.
\end{proof}

\begin{Lemma} Any intersection of faces is also a face.
\end{Lemma}
\begin{proof} By \ref{D} it suffices to show the intersection of two faces is a face. We have $(\sigma \cap u_1^{\perp} ) \cap (\sigma \cap u_2^{\perp} ) = \sigma \cap (u_1^{\perp} \cap u_2^{\perp} ).$ We claim that for $u_1, u_2\in \sigma^{\V},$ $\sigma \cap (u_1^{\perp} \cap u_2^{\perp} )= \sigma \cap (u_1 + u_2)^{\perp}.$ Linearity of the dual pairing gives $u_1^{\perp} \cap u_2^{\perp} \subseteq (u_1+u_2)^{\perp}$ so the $\subseteq$ direction holds. Now suppose $v\in \sigma \cap (u_1 + u_2)^{\perp}$ so $\langle v, u_1 \rangle + \langle v, u_2 \rangle =0.$ Both those terms are nonnegative since $u_i \in \sigma^{\V}.$ Therefore both terms are zero and $v\in \sigma \cap (u_1^{\perp} \cap u_2^{\perp} ).$
\end{proof}

\begin{Lemma} Any face of a face is a face.
\end{Lemma}
\begin{proof} Let $\tau$ be a face of $\sigma= \Cone(x_1, \cdots, x_k)$ so $\tau = \sigma \cap u^{\perp}$ for some $u\in \sigma^{\V},$ and let $\gamma$ be a face of $\tau$ so $\gamma = \tau \cap v^{\perp}$ for some $v\in \tau^{\V}.$ Let $p$ be some positive number. If $x_i \in \tau$ then $\langle x_i, v+pu \rangle \geq 0$ follows from the definitions of $\tau$ and $v.$ Now suppose $x_i \notin \tau.$ Since $u$ is nonnegative on $\sigma$ we have $\langle x_i, u \rangle \geq 0.$ Equality does not hold (for else $x_i \in \tau$). Let $ m' := \min_{x_i \notin \tau } \langle x_i, u \rangle > 0.$ Let $m$ be any negative number such that $m < \langle x_i , v \rangle$ for all $x_i \in \tau.$ Then $$ \langle x_i , v+pu \rangle = \langle x_i, v \rangle + p \langle x_i, u \rangle > m + pm'.$$

This is strictly positive if we take $p$ to be any integer greater than $-m/m',$ which we do for the rest of this proof. Since $v+pu$ is nonnegative on $\sigma,$ we have $v+pu \in \sigma^{\V}.$ We now claim that $\gamma = \sigma \cap (v+pu)^{\perp},$ which if true proves that $\gamma$ is a face of $\sigma.$ If $x\in \gamma= \tau \cap v^{\perp},$ then $x\in \sigma$ and $\langle x, v+pu \rangle =0$ so $\gamma \subseteq \sigma \cap (v+pu)^{\perp}.$ Now suppose $x\in \sigma \cap (v+pu)^{\perp},$ so $\langle x, v+pu \rangle=0.$ Writing $x = \sum a_i x_i \ , a_i \geq 0$ this is $\sum a_i \langle x_i , v+pu \rangle =0.$ We picked $p$ so that each term $\langle x_i, v+pu \rangle \geq 0$ with equality only possible if $x_i \in \tau.$ Therefore $x\in \tau.$ Since $\langle x, v \rangle + p \langle x, u \rangle =0,$ we have $x\in v^{\perp}$ since $x\in \tau$ implies the second term vanishes. Therefore $\sigma \cap (v+pu)^{\perp} \subseteq \gamma.$
\end{proof}

\begin{Lemma} Any face is contained in a {\em facet} (a face of codimension one). 
\end{Lemma}

\begin{Lemma} Any proper face is the intersection of all facets containing it. 
\end{Lemma}


\begin{Lemma} The boundary of a cone that spans $N_{\R}$ is the union of its proper faces (or facets).
\end{Lemma}

\begin{Lemma} If $\sigma$ is not equal to but spans $N_{\R}$ then it is the intersection of half spaces ...
\end{Lemma}


\begin{Proposition} \label{Dual is cone} The dual of a (rational) convex polyhedral cone is a (rational) convex polyhedral cone.  
\end{Proposition}

\begin{Lemma}\label{Separation Strong}
Suppose $\sigma, \sigma'$ are convex polyhedral cones such that $\tau:= \sigma \cap \sigma'$ is a face of both. Then there is a $u\in \sigma^{\V} \cap (-\sigma')^{\V}$ such that $\tau = \sigma \cap u^{\perp} = \sigma' \cap u^{\perp}.$
\end{Lemma} 

\begin{proof} Consider the convex polyhedral cone $\gamma = \sigma \cup (-\sigma').$ Taking duals of the inclusions $\sigma, -\sigma' \subseteq \gamma$ implies $\gamma^{\V} \subseteq \sigma^{\V} \cap (-\sigma')^{\V}.$ By \ref{Separation Strong} $\gamma^{\V}$ is a convex polyhedral cone. Take $u= \sum u_i$ where $u_i$ are generators of $\gamma^{\V}.$ By \ref{Dual is cone} we see $\gamma = \{ v | \langle u_i, v \rangle \geq 0 \forall i \}.$ If $v\in \gamma$ is such that $\langle u_i, v\rangle =0$ for all generators $u_i,$ then $-v\in \gamma.$ So if $v\in \gamma$ but $-v\notin \gamma$ then there exists some generator $u_k$ such that $\langle u_k, v \rangle \neq 0.$ Therefore $v\in \gamma \cap u^{\perp} $ if and only if $-v\in \gamma,$ so

$$ \gamma \cap u^{\perp} = \gamma \cap (-\gamma) = (\sigma \cup (-\sigma') ) \cap ( \sigma' \cup (-\sigma) ).$$

This implies that if $v\in \sigma \cap u^{\perp}$ then $v\in \sigma' \cup (-\sigma)$ so $v= w'-w$ for some $w\in \sigma, w'\in \sigma'.$ Thus $v+w \in \sigma\cap \sigma' = \tau.$ Since $\tau$ is a face there is a $z\in \sigma^{\V}$ such that $\tau = \sigma \cap z^{\perp}.$ Then $\langle z, v \rangle + \langle z, w\rangle =0.$ Both terms are nonnegative and hence vanish, so $\langle z, v\rangle =0$ and $v\in \tau.$ Therfore $\sigma \cap u^{\perp} \subseteq \tau.$ The displayed equation also implies $\tau \in u^{\perp},$ so $\tau = \sigma \cap u^{\perp}.$ By similar steps as above we have $\tau = \sigma' \cap u^{\perp}$ as well. 
\end{proof}

\begin{Lemma}\label{strongzero} Let $\sigma$ be a convex polyhedral cone. The following conditions are equivalent: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\sigma \cap (-\sigma) = \{ 0\};$
	\item $\sigma$ contains no linear subspace;
	\item $\{0\}$ is a face of $\sigma;$
	\item $\sigma^{\V}$ spans $M_{\R}.$
\end{enumerate}
\end{Lemma}

We call any convex polyhedral cone that satisfies one of the above conditions a {\em strongly convex} polyhedral cone. 

% Sort out all of this foundational cone stuff so we finally have dual cones are cones and seperation lemma. Also, dual of rational cone is rational cone. Then we introduce semi groups, prove Gordan's lemma, give an example of a cone and point out difference between generators of cone, and generators of the semi-group S_sigma. Prove two crucial lemmas. Then we finally start on affine toric varieties.

In this chapter we give a construction of toric varieties, our main object of study. We also provide many concrete examples and establish some of their most basic properties. 



\section{Preliminary Algebraic Geometry}

In this section we summarise some content from classical algebraic geometry. The proofs of the following facts can be found in most texts on algebraic geometryAnyone familiar with the material below should have sufficient background to read the rest of this paper. In particular, no knowledge of scheme theory is expected from the reader. 

Fix an algebraically closed field $k$. Affine space $\mathbb{A}^n$ is the set of n-tuples of elements of $k.$ It's vector space structure is ignored. An (affine) algebraic set $V=V(J)$ in $\mathbb{A}^n$ is a set of common zeros of an ideal $J\subseteq k[X_1,\cdots, X_n].$ $V(J) = V(\sqrt{J})$ so algebraic sets can always be viewed as the common zeros of some radical ideal. Hilbert's Nullstellensatz allows us to recover this ideal given an algebraic set : $IV(J) = \sqrt{J}.$ All maximal ideals of $k[X_1,\cdots, X_n]$ are of the form $(X_1-a_1, \cdots, X_n-a_n)$ for some $(a_1,\cdots, a_n) \in \mathbb{A}^n,$ so there is a natural correspondence which allows us to identify these ideals and points of $\mathbb{A}^n.$ There is also a correspondence between these and $k$-algebra homomorphisms $k[X_1,\cdots, X_n].$ In particular, all such maps are evaluation maps at some point in $\mathbb{A}^n,$ and the kernel is the maximal ideal corresponding to that point. 

The algebraic subsets are the closed sets in the Zariski topology on $\mathbb{A}^n.$ With this topology $\mathbb{A}^n$ is an irreducible topological space - it is not the union of two proper closed subsets. An irreducible closed subset of this topological space is called an affine variety. In an irreducible topological space, and in particular in affine varieties, non-empty open subsets are dense. An algebraic set $V(J)$ is irreducible if and only if $J$ is a prime ideal of $k[X_1,\cdots, X_n].$ The coordinate ring of an affine algebraic set $V\subseteq \mathbb{A}^n$ is the finitely generated reduced $k$-algebra $k[V]:= k[X_1,\cdots, X_n]/I(V).$ The elements of this algebra can be naturally identified with polynomial functions $V\to k.$ A morphism is a polynomial map $\phi$ between affine varieties $V\to W.$ These correspond to $k$-algebra homomorphisms $\phi^*: k[W] \to k[V].$ Two affine varieties are isomorphic if they have a bijective morphism between them whose inverse is also a morphism. In this case the morphisms correspond to $k$-algebra isomorphisms between their coordinate rings, so two affine varieties are isomorphic if and only if they have isomorphic coordinate rings. We often write that two isomorphic varieties are equal. 

We view affine varieties more instrinsically. For any ring $R$ we let its spectrum $\Spec R$ be the set of all prime ideals of $R.$ The Zariski topology on $\Spec R$ has closed sets $V(J):= \{ P\in \Spec R | J\subseteq P\}.$ Adding a sheaf of regular functions onto this gives an affine scheme. There is a one to one correspondence between affine schemes and commutative rings. When we restrict to reduced finitely generated $k$-algebras we recover the correspondence to affine algebraic sets. In practice when we write $\Spec$ we are only thinking of the maximal ideals as this is sufficient to visualise the points of the algebraic set, however taking all prime ideals proves to be convenient. We now compute an example. The coordinate ring of the affine variety $V(X^2+Y^2-1)\subseteq \mathbb{A}^2$ has coordinate ring $k[X,Y]/(X^2+Y^2-1).$ The maximal ideals of that ring correspond to maximal ideals of $k[X,Y]$ containing $(X^2+Y^2-1),$ which in turn correspond to points of $\mathbb{A}^2$ contained in $V(X^2+Y^2-1),$ so we have recovered the circle.

What is intrinsic about algebraic sets are not the particular sets itselfs, but their coordinate rings. For example, the punctured affine line $\mathbb{A}\setminus \{0\}\subset \mathbb{A}$ is not the zero set of any ideal in $k[X]$ since polynomials have only have finitely many roots. As explained in the next paragraph, it is an affine variety with coordinate ring $k[X]_X = k[X,X^{-1}] \cong k[X,Y]/(XY-1)$ and is therefore isomorphic to the hyperbola $V(XY-1)\subseteq \mathbb{A}^2.$ 


We say $\phi$ is dominant if it has dense image in $W.$ A morphism is dominant if and only if the corresponding map on coordinate rings is injective. For an algebraic set $V,$ the open sets $V_f := \{ x\in V : f(x)\neq 0 \}, f\in k[V]$ form a basis for the Zariski topology on $V.$ They are algebraic sets themselves, with coordinate rings $k[V]_f = k[V][1/f].$ If $V$ and $W$ are affine varieties then $V\times W$ is an affine variety with coordinate ring $k[V\times W] \cong k[V] \otimes k[W],$ where the tensor product is that of $k$-algebras.

The localisation of the coordinate ring at the maximal ideal corresponding to a point $p\in V$ can be naturally identified with the rational functions $V\to k$ defined at $p.$ It is called the ring of rational functions of $V$ at $p$ and is denoted $\mathcal{O}_p (V).$ It is a noetherian local ring with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}=\mathfrak{m}_p (V)$ consisting of the rational functions $V\to k$ that vanish at $p.$ The cotangent space to $V$ at $p$ is abstractly defined to be the $k$ vector space $\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2,$ and its tangent space is the dual of this. The point $p$ is a nonsingular point on $V$ if and only if $\dim_k \mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2 = \dim \mathcal{O}_p (V)$ where we are considering Krull dimension on the right. If $V$ is nonsingular for all $p\in V$ we say $V$ is smooth. A variety $X$ is said to be normal if the local ring at every point is an integrally closed domain. If $X$ is affine it suffices to show its coordinate ring is integrally closed. Smooth varieties are normal. Every finite birational morphism from any variety into a normal variety $X$ is an isomorphism. 

\section{Semigroups}
Recall that a {\em semigroup} is a set with an associative binary operation. In all of our examples the semigroup will have a commutative operation and identity, so they are monoids. 

\begin{Proposition}[Gordan's Lemma]\label{Gordan}
If $\sigma$ is a rational convex polyhedral cone, then $S_{\sigma}:= \sigma^{\V} \cap M$ is a finitely generated semigroup.
\end{Proposition}

\begin{proof}
By \ref{Dual is cone}, $\sigma^{\V}$ is a rational convex polyhedral cone i.e. $\sigma^{\V} = \Cone(u_1,\ldots, u_s)$ for some $u_i\in M.$ Let $K\subseteq M_{\R}$ be given by $\displaystyle K=\biggr\{ \sum_{i=1}^s t_i u_i \ \bigg| \ 0\leq t_i \leq 1 \biggr\}.$ Since $K$ is bounded and $M$ is a discrete set, $K\cap M$ finite. We claim that $K\cap M$ generates $S_{\sigma}.$ Indeed, for any $u\in S_{\sigma}$ write $u=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^s r_i u_i$ with $r_i\geq 0.$ We can uniquely write $r_i = a_i + b_i$ where $a_i$ is a nonnegative integer and $0\leq b_i <1.$ Then $\displaystyle u = \sum_{i=1}^s a_i u_i + \sum_{i=1}^s b_i u_i.$ Since $u_i\in K\cap M,$ the first sum is in $M,$ generated by $K\cap M.$ Modulo the lattice we have $u \equiv \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^s b_i u_i$ and since $u\in S_{\sigma} \subseteq M$ the second sum is in $M.$ By definition, it is in $K$ as well, so we have written $u$ as a sum of terms in $K\cap M$ with nonnegative integer coefficients. 
\end{proof}


% The next cruicial lemma, we give a full proof whereas most texts are skimpy on it. 

\begin{Proposition}\label{semigroup 1}
If $\tau$ is a face of $\sigma$ then $\tau = \sigma \cap u^{\perp}$ for some $u\in S_{\sigma}\cap M$ and $S_{\tau} = S_{\sigma} + \Z_{\geq 0} (-u).$
\end{Proposition}


\begin{proof}
Suppose $v_1,\cdots, v_k$ are generators of $\sigma,$ so any $v\in \sigma$ can be written $v=\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^k  r_i v_i$ where $r_i\in \Z_{\geq 0}.$ 

Since $\tau$ is a face of $\sigma$ by definition we have $\tau = \sigma \cap u^{\perp}$ for some $u\in \sigma^{\V},$ which we can also take to be in $M$ since $\sigma^{\V} \cap \tau^{\perp}$ is a rational cone. Let $w\in S_{\tau}$ and $p \in \Z_{\geq 0}.$ Then $$ \langle v , w+ pu \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^k r_i \left( \langle v_i , w \rangle + p \langle v_i, u\rangle \right).$$ Since $u\in \sigma^{\V},$ we have $\langle v_i, v \rangle \geq 0$ for all $i=1,\ldots, k.$ If $\langle v_i, w \rangle \geq 0$ the $i$-th term of the sum is nonnegative. If $\langle v_i , w \rangle < 0$ then since $w\in S_{\tau}$ we must have $v_i \notin \tau = \sigma \cap u^{\perp}.$ Combining this observation with $u\in \sigma^{\V}$ shows $\langle v_i, u \rangle \geq 0,$ so if $p > - \dfrac{\langle v_i, w \rangle}{\langle v_i, u\rangle}$ then the $i$-th term of the sum is nonnegative. Therefore if we take $p$ such that $$ p > \max_{ \{ 1\leq i \leq k \ | \ \langle v_i, w \rangle < 0 \} } - \frac{\langle v_i, w \rangle}{\langle v_i, u\rangle} $$ then the sum is nonnegative. This does not depend on the specific $r_i,$ so we have $\langle v , w+pu \rangle \geq 0$ for all $v\in \sigma$ i.e. $w+pu \in \sigma^{\V}.$ Since $w, u \in M$ as well we have $w+pu \in S_{\sigma}.$ Therefore $w\in S_{\sigma} + \Z_{\geq 0} (-u),$ which proves $S_{\tau} \subseteq S_{\sigma} + \Z_{\geq 0} (-u).$ Conversely, for $w\in S_{\sigma}$ and $p\in \Z_{\geq 0}$ we have $\langle v, w-pu\rangle = \langle v, w \rangle - p \langle v, u \rangle.$ For any $v\in \tau = \sigma \cap u^{\perp},$ the second term vanishes and the first term is nonnegative since $w\in S_{\sigma} \subseteq \sigma^{\V}.$ Hence $w-pu \in \tau^{\V}$ and combining this with $w,u \in M$ we have $w-pu \in S_{\tau}.$ This proves $S_{\sigma} + \Z_{\geq 0} (-u) \subseteq S_{\tau}.$

\end{proof}

\begin{Proposition} If $\tau:= \sigma \cap \sigma'$ is a face of $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$ then $S_{\tau} = S_{\sigma} + S_{\sigma'}.$
\end{Proposition}

\begin{proof} It follows from the definitions that $S_{\sigma} + S_{\sigma'} \subseteq S_{\tau}.$ By \ref{Separation Strong} we can take $u\in \sigma^{\V} \cap (-\sigma')^{\V}$ such that $\tau = \sigma \cap u^{\perp} = \sigma' \cap u^{\perp}.$ By \ref{semigroup 1} we have $S_{\tau} = S_{\sigma} + \Z_{\geq 0} (-u).$ Since $u\in (-\sigma')^{\V}$ we have $-u \in S_{\sigma'}$ so $S_{\tau} \subseteq S_{\sigma} + S_{\sigma'}.$ 
\end{proof}

For any semigroup $S$ there is an associated $k$-algebra denoted $k[S]$ with basis elements being the set of symbols $\chi^\mu , \mu \in S$ (so the elements are finite sums of the form $\sum a_i \chi^{\mu_i} \ , a_i\in k$) and multiplication given by $\chi^{\mu} \chi^{\mu'} = \chi^{\mu+\mu'}.$


\section{Affine Toric Varieties}

From this point on we shall only deal with strongly convex rational polyhedral cones, which we just call {\em cones}, and we take our ground field to be $\C.$


\begin{Definition}Let $N$ be an $n$ dimensional lattice and $\sigma$ a cone in $N_{\R}.$ The {\em affine toric variety} corresponding to $\sigma$ is defined to be $U_{\sigma}:= \Spec (\C[S_{\sigma}]).$ 
\end{Definition}

\begin{Remark}
~
\begin{enumerate}

	\item By Gordan's Lemma (\ref{Gordan}) the associated semigroup $S_{\sigma}:= \sigma^{\V} \cap M$ is finitely generated, say by $\mu_1, \ldots, \mu_k,$ so $\C[S_{\sigma}] =\C[\chi^{\mu_1} , \chi^{\mu_2} , \ldots , \chi^{\mu_k} ]$ is finitely generated. From the multiplication rule we observe that it has no zero divisors. Since $\C[S_{\sigma}]$ is a finitely generated $\C$-algebra which is a domain, $U_{\sigma}$ is indeed an affine variety. We will see this from another view below.
	\item We review the steps in the procedure of constructing affine toric varieties. Starting from a cone $\sigma$ in a lattice, compute the dual cone $\sigma^{\V}$ (this only required solving linear equations). Intersect that with the dual lattice to form the semigroup $S_{\sigma}.$ We then find generators for that semigroup (the proof of \ref{Gordan} constructs a generating set) and use them to write down $\C[S_{\sigma}].$ Taking the spectrum of this algebra gives the toric variety. 
	
	
\end{enumerate}
\end{Remark}

\begin{Definition} The {\em algebraic $n$-torus} is the affine variety $(\C^*)^n = \{ (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in \C^n \ | x_i\neq 0 \ \forall i\}.$
\end{Definition}

\begin{Lemma}\label{zerotorus} Take $N$ to be an $n$ dimensional lattice. The affine toric variety corresponding to the zero cone is the $n$-torus.
\end{Lemma}

\begin{proof} Consider the cone $\sigma = 0.$ The dual cone is the entire dual space; $\sigma^{\V} = M_{\R}.$ Hence our corresponding semigroup is $S_{0} = M_{\R} \cap M = M,$ which is generated by $e_1, -e_1, e_2, -e_2, \ldots, e_n, -e_n.$ Therefore
\begin{align*}
\C[S_0] &= \C[\chi^{e_1}, \chi^{-e_1}, \chi^{e_2}, \chi^{-e_2}, \ldots , \chi^{e_n}, \chi^{-e_n}] \\
        &\cong \C[X_1, X_1^{-1}, X_2, X_2^{-1}, \ldots, X_n, X_n^{-1}] \\
				&=\C[X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n]_{X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n}.
\end{align*}
The spectrum of this is the set of points in $\C^n$ satisfying $x_i \neq 0 \ \forall i.$ Therefore $U_0 = (\C^*)^n.$

\end{proof}

\begin{Example} \label{smoothbase}
 Let $N$ be a $d$ dimensional lattice and let $\sigma = \Cone(b_1,\ldots, b_k)$ where $k\leq d$ and $\{b_i\}$ can be extended to a basis of $N.$ Then $r_1 b_1 + \ldots + r_d b_d \in \sigma^{\V}$ if and only if $\langle b_i , r_1 b_1 + \ldots + r_d b_d \rangle= r_i \geq 0 $ for all $i=1,\ldots, k.$ So $\sigma^{\V} = \Cone(b_1, \ldots, b_k, b_{k+1}, -b_{k+1}, \ldots, b_d, -b_d).$ Then $S_{\sigma}$ has generators $ b_1, \ldots, b_k,   b_{k+1}, -b_{k+1}, \ldots, b_d, -b_d$ and $\C[S_{\sigma}] = \C[X_1, \ldots, X_k, X_{k+1}, X_{k+1}^{-1}, \ldots, X_d, X_d^{-1}]= \C[X_1,\ldots, X_d]_{X_{k+1}, \ldots, X_d}.$ Therefore $U_{\sigma} = \Spec \C[S_{\sigma}] = \C^k \times (\C^*)^{n-k}.$
\end{Example}

\begin{Example} 
 Let $N=\Z^2$ and $\sigma = \Cone(e_2, 2e_1 - e_2).$

Since $S_{\sigma}$ is generated by $e_1, e_1+e_2$ and $e_1+2e_2$ we have $\C[S_{\sigma}] = \C[X,XY,XY^2].$ Consider the $\C$-algebra homomorphism $\varphi: \C[U,V,W]\to \C[X,XY,XY^2]$ that sends $U \mapsto X, V \mapsto XY$ and $W \mapsto XY^2.$ Let $I= (V^2-UW).$ Note that $I\subseteq \ker \varphi.$ We claim the reverse containment holds as well. To see this, suppose $p(U,V,W)\in \ker \varphi,$ so $p(X,XY, XY^2)=0.$ By alway writing $V^2 = UW + (V^2-UW)$ we can write $p(U,V,W) = g(U,W) + h(U,W)V + q(U,V,W)(V^2-UW)$ for polynomials $g,h,q.$ Suppose $g(X,XY^2)+h(X,XY^2)XY=0.$ In the first term all powers of $Y$ are even while in the second they are all odd, so $g(X,XY^2) = h(X,XY^2)=0.$ If $g(U,V) = \sum a_{ij} U^i V^j$ then $0=g(X,XY^2) = \sum a_{ij} X^{i+j} Y^{2j}$ so $a_{ij}=0$ and $g(U,V)=0.$ Similarly we get $h(U,V)=0.$ Therefore $\ker \varphi = I.$ From the first isomorphism theorem we now conclude that $\C[X,XY,XY^2] \cong \C[U,V,W]/(V^2-UW).$ Therefore $U_{\sigma} = \Spec (\C[U,V,W]/(V^2-UW))$ is isomorphic to the elliptic cone in $\C^3$ whose equation is $y^2=xz.$ Note that the curve has a singularity at the origin. It is a rational double point of type $A.$ For more on rational singularities see \cite{Reid:DuVal, Slodowy, Steinberg-Conjugacy}.

\end{Example}




A semigroup homomorphism $\varphi: S \to S'$ determines a map $\C[S] \to \C[S']$ by sending $\chi^{\mu}$ to $\chi^{\varphi (\mu)}.$ This induces a map $\Spec (\C[S']) \to \Spec (\C[S]).$ In particular, if $\tau$ is a face of a cone $\sigma$ we have a morphism $U_{\tau} \to U_{\sigma}.$

\begin{Lemma}\label{faceopen} If $\tau$ is a face of $\sigma,$ the natural map $U_{\tau} \to U_{\sigma}$ embeds $U_{\tau}$ as a principal open subset of $U_{\sigma}.$ 
\end{Lemma}

\begin{proof} Since $\tau$ is a face we can write $\tau = \sigma \cap u^{\perp}$ for some $u\in S_{\sigma}.$ By \ref{semigroup 1} we have $S_{\tau} = S_{\sigma} + \Z_{\geq 0} (-u).$ Hence for any $w'\in \tau$ we have $w' = w-pu$ for some $w\in S_{\sigma}, p\in \Z_{\geq 0}.$ In $\C[S_{\tau}]$ this is $\chi^{w'} = \chi^w (\chi^{-u})^{-p},$ so $\C[S_{\tau}] = \C[S_{\sigma}][(\chi^u)^{-1}].$ The coordinate ring of $U_{\tau}$ is the localisation  of the coordinate ring of $U_{\sigma}$ at $\chi^u$ so the corresponding map $U_{\tau} \to U_{\sigma}$ embeds $U_{\tau}$ as a principal open subset of $U_{\sigma}.$

\end{proof}

\begin{Theorem}\label{torusdenseaffine}
Affine toric varieties contain an algebraic torus as an open dense subset.
\end{Theorem}
\begin{proof} Recall cones are strongly convex rational polyhedral cones, so by \ref{strongzero} $\{ 0\}$ is a face of every cone. Lemmas \ref{faceopen} and \ref{zerotorus} then imply that an algebraic torus is embedded as an open subset of all affine toric varieties. Further, the map $(\C^*)^n \to U_{\sigma}$ corresponds to the injective map on coordinate rings $\C[S_{\sigma}] \to \C[S_{0}]$ so it has dense image.
\end{proof}

\begin{Remark} We have purposely avoided using the fact that open subsets of irreducible spaces are dense in the previous proof. Our approach provides another perspective to the irreducibility of affine toric varieties. An algebraic torus is irreducible. Since topological spaces that have irreducible dense subspaces are irreducible we see again that affine toric varieties are deserving of their name. We can view the same argument algebraically as follows: Our construction of affine toric varieties was such that their coordinate rings are subrings of the integral domain $\C[X_1, X_1^{-1}, \ldots, X_n, X_n^{-1}].$ Therefore these coordinate rings are integral domains themselves, implying the irreducibility of their corresponding variety. 
\end{Remark}


\begin{Lemma} Let $\sigma$ be a cone in a lattice $N$ and $\sigma'$ a cone in a lattice $N'.$ Then $\sigma \times \sigma'$ is a cone in $N\oplus N'$ and $U_{\sigma \times \sigma'} = U_{\sigma} \times U_{\sigma'}.$
\end{Lemma}

\begin{proof} It suffices to show the corresponding identity on coordinate rings: $\C[S_{\sigma \times \sigma'} ] \cong \C[S_{\sigma}] \otimes \C[S_{\sigma'}].$ We are ensured by Gordan's lemma (\ref{Gordan}) that $S_{\sigma}$ has finitely many generators $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ and $S_{\sigma'}$ has finitely many generators $b_1, \ldots, b_m.$ Then $S_{\sigma \times \sigma'}$ is generated by $(a_1,0),\ldots, (a_n,0),$ $ (0,b_1), \ldots, (0,b_m).$ The coordinate rings are $\C[S_{\sigma}] = \C[\chi^{a_1}, \ldots, \chi^{a_n}] , \C[S_{\sigma'}] = \C[\eta^{b_1}, \ldots, \eta^{b_m} ] $ and $\C[S_{\sigma \times \sigma'}] = \C[\chi^{a_1}, \ldots, \chi^{a_n}, \eta^{b_1}, \ldots, \eta^{b_m} ].$ Let $\varphi: \C[S_{\sigma}] \otimes \C[S_{\sigma'}]$ be the $\C$-algebra homomorphism defined by $x \otimes y \mapsto xy.$ The $\C$-algebra map $\phi: \C[S_{\sigma\times \sigma'}] \to \C[S_{\sigma}] \otimes \C[S_{\sigma'}]$ which sends $\chi^a \eta^b \mapsto \chi^a \otimes \eta^b$ is well defined because there are no relations between that $\chi$ and $\eta$ terms. It is mutally inverse to $\varphi,$ so the required isomorphism holds.
\end{proof}

\begin{Lemma} Suppose $\Theta : N \to N'$ is a lattice isomorphism (that is, an isomorphism of finite rank $\Z$-modules) and $\sigma$ is a cone in $N.$ Then $\sigma':= \Theta(\sigma) $ is a cone in $N'$ and $U_{\sigma}= U_{\sigma'}.$
\end{Lemma}
 
\begin{proof} Suppose $\sigma = \Cone(u_1,\ldots, u_k).$ By Gordan's lemma (\ref{Gordan}) $S_{\sigma}$ has finitely many generators $s_1,\ldots, s_m.$ Then $\sigma'= \Cone(\Theta(u_1),\ldots, \Theta(u_k))$ and $S_{\sigma'}$ has generators $\Theta(s_1),\ldots, \Theta(s_m).$ The $\C$-algebra homomorphism $\varphi: \C[\chi^{s_1},\ldots, \chi^{s_m} ] \to \C[\chi^{\Theta(s_1)},\ldots, \chi^{\Theta(s_m)} ]$ determined by $\chi^u \mapsto \chi^{\Theta(u)}$ is an isomorphism of the relevant coordinate rings.

\section{Abstract Toric Varieties}



Define Gluing and stuff.


\begin{Example}[One dimensional toric varieties]
Let $N=\Z$ and $\Delta = \{0, \sigma, \sigma'\}$ as shown below:
\begin{figure}[ht]

\foreach \x in {-4,-2,0,2,4}{% Two indices running over each
      \foreach \y in {0}{% node on the grid we have drawn 
        \node[draw,circle,inner sep=1pt,fill] at (\x,\y) {};
            % Places a dot at those points
      }
    }
\draw [ultra thick,-latex,blue] (0,0)
        -- (2,0) node [below ]{$e_1$};
\draw [ultra thick,-latex,blue] (0,0)
        -- (-2,0) node [below] {$-e_1$};

\draw [blue] (0,0) node [below]{0};
\draw (-0.7,0.5) node{\scalebox{1.2}{$\sigma'$ }};
\draw (0.9,0.45) node{\scalebox{1.2}{$\sigma$ }};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

We have $\sigma = \sigma^{\V} = \Cone(e_1)$ so $S_{\sigma}$ is generated by $e_1$ so $\C[S_{\sigma}] = \C[X].$ Similarly, $\sigma' = (\sigma')^{\V} =\Cone(-e_1)$ so $S_{\sigma'}$ is generated by $-e_1$ so $\C[S_{\sigma'}]=\C[X^{-1}].$ As usual, $\C[S_{0}] = \C[X,X^{-1}].$ Both $U_{\sigma}$ and $U_{\sigma'}$ are copies of $\C$ and $X(\Delta)$ is obtained by gluing the images of the embeddings $$ \imath : U_0 = \Spec \C[X,X^{-1}] \to U_{\sigma} = \Spec \C[X] $$ $$ \ \imath': U_{0} = \Spec \C[X,X^{-1}] \to U_{\sigma'} = \Spec \C[X^{-1}] . $$ Let $\m_a$ be the maximal ideal of $\C[X,X^{-1}]$ corresponding to $a\in \C^*.$ It is the kernel of the evaluation map $\epsilon_a: \C[X,X^{-1}] \to \C$ that sends $p(X,X^{-1}) \mapsto p(a,a^{-1}).$ We compute $\imath(\m_a) = \m_a \cap \C[X] = \{ \text{polynomials in} \ \C[X] \text{ such that} \ p(a)=0 \} = (X-a)$ which is the ideal corresponding to the point $X=a.$ Similarly, $\imath'(\m_a) = \m_a \cap \C[X^{-1}] = \{ \text{polynomials in} \ \C[Y] \text{ such that} \ p(a^{-1})=0 \}$ which is the ideal corresponding to the point $X=a^{-1}.$ Therefore we have $$X(\Delta) = \frac{ \C \bigsqcup \C}{ (a \sim a^{-1})_{a\neq 0} }.$$ Recall the construction of the complex projective line $\Proj^1(\C).$ It is covered by two copies of the affine line: $\Proj^1(\C) = \{ [x:1] \ | \ x\in \C \} \cup \{ [1:x] \ | \ x\in \C \}$ where the overlap is glued via the identification $[a:1] = [1:a^{-1}]$ for all $a\neq 0.$ This is the exact same construction as the toric variety, so $X(\Delta) = \Proj^1(\C).$ The only other one dimensional fans are $\{\sigma, 0 \} , \{ \sigma', 0 \}$ and $\{ 0\}$ which correspond to $\C, \C $ and $\C^*$ respectively. So the only one dimensional toric varieties are $\C^*, \C$ and $\Proj^1(\C).$
\end{Example}

Reading off the picture, $S_{\sigma_1}$ has generators $e_1, e_2$ we have $\C[S_{\sigma_1}] = \C[X,Y].$ The semigroup $S_{\sigma_2}$ has generators $-e_1, -e_1+e_2$ so $\C[S_{\sigma_2}] = \C[X^{-1} , X^{-1}Y].$ Similarly, $S_{\sigma_3}$ has generators $-e_2, e_1-e_2$ so $\C[S_{\sigma_3}] = \C[Y^{-1} , XY^{-1}].$ So we have three copies of $\C^2$ with each pair overlapping on $U_{0} = (\C^*)^2.$ The gluing construction does the following on the overlaps: We glue $(x,y)$ from $U_{\sigma_1}$ to $(x^{-1}, x^{-1}y)$ on $U_{\sigma_2}$ and to $(x^{-1}y, x^{-1})$ on $U_{\sigma_3}.$ We also glue $(x,y)$ from $U_{\sigma_2}$ to $(xy^{-1}, y^{-1})$ on $U_{\sigma_3}.$ Notice that $\Proj^2(\C) = \{ [1:x:y] \ | \ (x,y) \in \C^2 \}\cup \{ [x:1:y] \ | \ (x,y) \in \C^2 \}\cup \{ [x:y:1] \ | \ (x,y) \in \C^2 \}$ is three copies of $\C^2$ glued via exactly the same rules. Therefore $X(\Delta) = \Proj^2(\C).$ The same type of calculation works for arbitrary dimension. Suppose $N=\Z^d$ and let $e_0 = -(e_1+e_2+\ldots+e_d).$ Then $\Delta = \{ \Cone(E) \ | \ E\subseteq \{e_0, \ldots, e_d\} \}$ is a fan such that $X(\Delta) = \Proj^d(\C).$

Then $\sigma^{\V}_1=\Cone(e_1, e_2)$ and $\sigma_2^{\V} = \Cone(-e_1, -e_2).$ Thus $S_{\sigma_1}$ is generated by $e_1, e_2$ while $S_{\sigma_2}$ is generated by $-e_1, -e_2$ and therefore $\C[S_{\sigma_1}] = \C[X,Y], \C[S_{\sigma_2}]=\C[X^{-1}, Y^{-1}].$ The gluing construction identifies the images of the natural embeddings $$ \imath : U_0 = \Spec \C[X,X^{-1},Y , Y^{-1}] \to U_{\sigma_1} = \Spec \C[X,Y] $$ $$ \ \imath': U_{0} = \Spec \C[X,X^{-1}, Y ,Y^{-1}] \to U_{\sigma_2} = \Spec \C[X^{-1}, Y^{-1}] . $$
Let $(a,b)\in (\C^*)^2$ and $\m_{a,b}$ be the maximal ideal of $\C[X,X^{-1}, Y, Y^{-1}]$ corresponding to it. It is the kernel of the evaluation map $\epsilon_{a,b} : \C[X,X^{-1},Y, Y^{-1}] \to \C$ that sends $p(X,X^{-1}, Y, Y^{-1}) \mapsto p(a,a^{-1}, b, b^{-1}).$ We have $\imath(\m_{a,b}) = \m_{a,b} \cap \C[X,Y]$ which corresponds to the point $(a,b),$ and $\imath'(\m_{a,b}) = \m_{a,b} \cap \C[X^{-1}, Y^{-1}]$ which corresponds to the point $(a^{-1}, b^{-1}).$ Therefore $$ X(\Delta) = \frac{ \C^2 \bigsqcup \C^2 }{ \left( (a,b) \sim (a^{-1}, b^{-1}) \right)_{a,b\neq 0} }.$$ This object is more exotic than the previous examples. Readers familiar with blow ups may recognise this as the blow up of $\C^2$ along the coordinate axes. Standard references to learn about blow ups are \cite[p.~ 602-610]{GriffithsHarris}, \cite[Chapter 4, \S 2]{EisenbudHarris}, \cite[Chapter 2, \S 4]{Shafarevich1} and \cite[Chapter 1]{Hartshorne}. A beautifully motivated and illustrated source is \cite{Brodmann}.

\begin{Theorem} Toric varieties contain an algebraic torus as a dense open subset.
\end{Theorem}
\begin{proof} By \ref{torusdenseaffine} $U_{\sigma}$ contains an algebraic torus as a dense open subset for every $\sigma \in \Delta.$ The claim follows since $X(\Delta)$ is covered by affine pieces of that form.
\end{proof}

\begin{Theorem} If $\Delta$ is a fan in $N$ and $\Delta'$ is a fan in $N'$ then $\Delta \times \Delta' := \{ \sigma \times \sigma ' | \sigma \in \Delta, \sigma' \in \Delta' \}$ is a fan in $N \oplus N'$ and $X(\Delta \times \Delta') = X(\Delta) \times X(\Delta').$
\end{Theorem}


\begin{Theorem} 
Toric varieties are normal.
\end{Theorem}

\begin{proof} It suffices to prove the result locally i.e. for affine toric varieties. Let $\sigma = \Cone(u_1, \ldots, u_r)$ and $\tau_i=\Cone(u_i).$ Note that for each $i,$ we can scale $u_i$ to write $\tau_i = \Cone(b_i)$ where the components of $b_i$ are coprime. The proof of the previous theorem shows that the sublattice generated by $b_i$ is saturated and therefore is a direct factor of the lattice $N.$ Picking a basis of the complementary factor corresponds to including $b_i$ in a basis of the lattice. We have $\sigma^{\V} = \cap \tau_i^{\V}$ so $\C[S_{\sigma}] = \cap \C[S_{\tau_i}].$ By the previous theorem, $\C[S_{\tau_i}] \cong \C[X_1, X_2, X_2^{-1}, \ldots, X_n, X_n^{-1}]$ is integrally closed. The intersection of integrally closed domains is integrally closed so the result follows.
\end{proof}


\chapter{Geometry of Toric Varieties}
As a field algebraic geometry has undergone many transformations in the last century. The objects of study have been greatly generalised and the tools with which study them have gained enormous power. Thus, it may surprise the beginner that the classical questions about varieties are still relevant. Is the variety smooth? If not, what is the structure of its singularities? Can we resolve them? When are they compact or connected? Toric varieties have a special feature in that they are flexible enough to demonstrate non-trivial geometric properties, but simple enough to have satisfying answers to these questions. In this section we develop some of the geometric properties of toric varieties. 

\section{Completeness of Toric Varieties}

\section{Smoothness of Affine Toric Varieties}
\begin{Theorem} An affine toric variety $U_{\sigma}$ is smooth if and only if $\sigma$ is generated by a subset of a basis for the lattice $N,$ and if so then $U_{\sigma} = \C^k \times (\C^{*})^{n-k},$ where $k=\dim (\sigma).$
 
\end{Theorem}

\begin{proof}
 We have already computed in \ref{smoothbase} that a toric variety corresponding to a cone generated by a subset of a basis is of the stated form. Conversely,......
