## Structure of the folder

1. anomaly_detection: contains data from XPlane and an ipynb file that tries to build anomaly data according to the paper.

2. **sgd_quant_est**: SGD quantile estimation experiment. Currently very messy, I am trying to arrange everything in the Experiment_final and Experiment_test files and save the results images in another folder. The old file is the comparison_image_generation.ipynb, which will be deleted when the new files are finished.

3. Q_init: a bit of research that shows how a initial value of quantile estimate might help with the estimation acuracy.

4. thesis: the latex files about my draft.

5. weekly_notes: the notes about weekly meeting notes or the records of my work. Basically nothing inside QAQ
