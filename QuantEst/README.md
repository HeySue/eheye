# Stochasic Gradient Descent (SGD) for Quantile Estimation

## Project description

In this project, we explore the usage of SGD on quantile estimation on data streams.
This project contains both experimental code and the research results.

## Structure of the folder


1. `code/`: SGD quantile estimation experiment. It contains code for the experiment

     - `.ipynb` files: main code to run the experiment
     - `.py`  files: the code that are used as libraries for the main running files.


4. `thesis/`: The Latex files for my honours thesis.

3. `Q_init/`: Not included in the final thesis results.
   - A bit of research that shows how a initial value of quantile estimate might help with the estimation accuracy.

1. `anomaly_detection/`: Not included in the final thesis results.
   - Contains data from XPlane and an ipynb file that tries to build anomaly data according to the paper.
