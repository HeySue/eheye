\section{Smooth Functions}
The pinball loss function we use for the SGD quantile estimation is convex but not smooth. 
Theoretically, however, both SGD and SAG methods need smoothness for the guarantee of convergence. Although the practical experiments have shown that there is evidence of convergence in final performance, it remains a serious problem for our SGD quantile estimation methods. In this section, we present the analysis on the non-smoothness problem, followed by the potential solutions and further discussions on them.

\subsection{The Pinball Loss Functions}
The pinball loss function evaluates the loss from a data point $x$ for estimation of the $tau$-quantile.
