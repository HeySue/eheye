\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch: conclusion}

Propose the sgd algorithm by the derivation from frugal 
proved they are equal to some extend. specifically, in t

Test the effectiveness of SGD by empirical experiments. 
4 different aspects: data distribution, data size, data ordering, SGD step size

Explore the step size adaptation of SGD and proposed two algorithms
Proposed an SAG method, with empirical experiment and , also a DB-SGD that not quite solve the problem (but yes improvement)
Reasoned why Newton methods not work

Explore the extension on multi-quantile estimation. Compared two algorithms shiftQ and P2.
