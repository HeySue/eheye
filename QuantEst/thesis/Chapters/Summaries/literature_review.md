### Streaming data and quantile estimation

1. Overall intro
   - The field of quantile estimation is big
   - this chapter details some of the work that has been done in the quantile estimation on streaming data, organised as follows:
   - details some of the current quantile estimation methods on the streaming data phenomenon, which are classified wrt algorithm types(?), while section 3.2 and 3.3 classify quantile estimation problems by aims
   - discuss algorithms on ?
   - present the relatively new problem: algorithms on multi-quantile estimation
2. Streaming data
