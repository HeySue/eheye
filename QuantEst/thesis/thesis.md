### Questions

1. Main problem: the description of experiment datasets and the measurements equation:
   1. How to mention them in nearly all chapters?
      1. **SOLUTION**: mention them once in a chapter, and then refer to that part every time for a new chapter.
   2. More data results (instead of only plots) for quantile value error and process?
      1. **NO**

2. Other issues of thesis writing are in the comments

### Plans:

#### Each chapter

1. State the problem as precisely as you can
2. write the story
3. say again what you have solved

#### Introduction

1. check the examiners -- do they know sgd / quantile, or frugal(1.2) Talk about **frugal1U** in introduction. 
2. put **background** before sec 1.4
3. In sec 1.4: claim(one paragraph, do not merge it with contents) **Contributions** of this thesis are

#### Conclusion chapter 
1. repeat exactly the same words but with more accurate words. (what you did) lot more details


#### Multi-quantile
1. why P2 better than shiftQ do an experiment that can help explain

smooth function(?)
