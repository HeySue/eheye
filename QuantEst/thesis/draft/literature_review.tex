\section{Quantile Estimation From Streaming Data}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why useful: \\
        \cite{rayArtApproximatingDistributions1800}(Industrial use) "
        Many businesses care about accurately computing quantiles over their key metrics, which can pose several interesting challenges at scale. 

        e.g. Price for advertisement on bidding level: quantile estimation helps price setting
        "\\\\
        Other industrial usage mentioned in \cite{hongEstimatingQuantileSensitivities2009}, and its citations for industrial use \\
        "
        Quantiles have been adopted by many industries as major
        measures of random performance. In the financial industry,
        quantiles, also known as value-at-risks (VaRs), are widely
        accepted measures of capital adequacy. For example, the
        Bank for International Settlement uses the 10-day VaR at
        the 99\% level to measure the adequacy of bank capital
        (Duffie and Pan 1997). In the service industry, quantiles
        are often used as measures of service quality. For example, the service quality of an out-of-hospital system is frequently measured by the 90th percentile of the times taken
        to respond to emergency requests and to transport patients
        to a hospital (Austin and Schull 2003). Quantiles have
        also been used as billing measures in some circumstances.
        For example, some Internet service providers (ISPs) charge
        their users based on the 95th percentile of the traffic load
        in a billing cycle (Goldenberg et al. 2004).
