\section{Introduction}

% \subsection{Aims}
This experiment has two purposes. The first is to show quantile estimation with SGD works \textcolor{blue}{ under some circimstances (?)}.
The second aim is to investigate how different settings of the problem effect the estimation performance.
In the experiment, multiple datasets are generated as input data streams, based on which the calculated and estimated quantile values are computed. Results of both quantiles are compared after processing. We want to compare the performance of quantile estimation over different settings.
% \\\\
% To test the SGD quantile estimation as a valid alternative for quantile estimation, this experiment computes both estimated and calculated values for quantiles, and evaluates whether the difference between the results is acceptable.
% \\\\
% Do I explain the second goal...?


\section{Methodology}
Throw dice randomly
\section{Observations}
No observation so far. Girls are pretty \smiley{}
\section{Discussion? Accuracy of study?}
We all agree girls are pretty. 100\% accuraty.
% \begin{equation}
%     E = | \frac{q_{batch} - q_{sgd}}{{q_{batch}}^{(1)} - {q_{batch}}^{(2)}} |

\section{Conclusion}
We should have Messina for dinner
